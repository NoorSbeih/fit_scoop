# fit_scoop

 FitScoop is an innovative fitness application designed to revolutionize the way people approach their health and wellness routines. Our goal was to create an all-encompassing platform that not only motivates users to stay fit but also provides them with personalized tools and resources to achieve their fitness goals.

 Key Features of FitScoop:
- Workout Reviews: Users can read and write reviews for various workouts, helping them choose routines that best fit their needs.
- User Profiles: Detailed profiles allow users to track their progress, set goals, and share their achievements with the community.
- Workout Schedules: Users can create and manage personalized workout schedules to stay on track.
- Search Functionality: Easily search for users, workouts, and reviews to find the most relevant content.
- Core Feature - Workout Plan Generation: The core feature of our app is the workout plan generation. Our machine learning algorithms analyze usersâ€™ inputs, then the app generates a tailored workout schedule that 
 aligns with their fitness goals and preferences.

Technology Stack: FitScoop is built using Flutter for a seamless cross-platform experience. The machine learning components are integrated using Python and TensorFlow to provide real-time, data-driven insights.
